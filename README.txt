A Pattern Processor (PAT) Documentation
=======================================

The PAT processor is available in 8-bit and 32-bit datapath flavours. Each shares a common ISA, which uses a fixed width of 23-bits per instruction.

8-bit and 32-bit versions of the processor have been taped out on an AMS 180nm High voltage process.
